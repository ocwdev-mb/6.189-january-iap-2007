  "course_title": "Multicore Programming Primer",
  "course_description": "The course serves as an introductory course in parallel programming. It offers a series of lectures on parallel programming concepts as well as a group project providing hands-on experience with parallel programming. The students will have the unique opportunity to use the cutting-edge PLAYSTATION 3 development platform as they learn how to design and implement exciting applications for multicore architectures. At the end of the course, students will have an understanding of:\n\n*   Fundamental design philosophies that multicore architectures address.\n*   Parallel programming philosophies and emerging best practices.\n\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month. The course can be tailored to a normal semester time line.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThe course instructors are extremely grateful to [Sony](http://www.sony.com/), [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/us/), and [Toshiba](http://www.toshiba.com/tai/) for their support.\n",
